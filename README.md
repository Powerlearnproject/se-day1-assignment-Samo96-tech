Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Birth of Software Development (1950s):
In the early days of computing, programming was done using assembly and machine languages. This period marked the inception of software development as a distinct discipline. The focus was primarily on writing code to perform specific tasks, often without structured methodologies.

The Software Crisis and Structured Programming (1960s):
As software projects grew in size and complexity, the industry faced what is known as the "software crisis." This crisis highlighted the difficulties in managing large software projects, leading to the development of structured programming techniques. These techniques emphasized the importance of clear structure and design in programming, paving the way for better project management and quality assurance.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s):
The 1980s saw the emergence of object-oriented programming (OOP), which introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP allowed developers to create more modular and reusable code, significantly improving software maintainability and scalability. This paradigm shift influenced many modern programming languages and frameworks.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning:
This initial phase involves defining the scope and purpose of the project. Stakeholders identify the objectives, resources, timelines, and potential risks. A project plan is created to guide the development process.

Requirements Analysis:
In this phase, developers gather and analyze the requirements from stakeholders. This includes understanding user needs, functional requirements, and any constraints. The goal is to create a clear and detailed requirements specification document.

Design:
The design phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software. This includes architectural design, user interface design, and database design. The aim is to create a comprehensive design document that outlines how the software will function.

Implementation (Coding):
During this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built, and it often involves collaboration among team members to ensure that the code is efficient and meets the requirements.

Testing:
After coding, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects or issues. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed to ensure the software meets quality standards.

Deployment:
Once testing is complete and the software is deemed ready, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training to ensure a smooth transition for end-users.

Maintenance:
The final phase involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software. This includes fixing bugs, implementing updates, and making enhancements based on user feedback. Maintenance ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.
